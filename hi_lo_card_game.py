# Hi-Lo Card Game
# USING A WHILE OR A DO-WHILE LOOP write a program which allows

# The Hi-Lo card game is one where the user is presented with an initial card
# (2 â€“ 10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace) 
# and has to guess that the next card with be 
# Higher (Hi), Lower (Lo) or Equal to the current card.
# They must guess successfully 4 times in a row in order to win.
